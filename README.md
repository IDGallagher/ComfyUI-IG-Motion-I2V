[ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) implementation of [Motion-I2V](https://xiaoyushi97.github.io/Motion-I2V/)
This is currently a diffusers wrapper with code adapted from [https://github.com/G-U-N/Motion-I2V](https://github.com/G-U-N/Motion-I2V)
## Updates
- [2024/9/24] ðŸ”¥ First Release
- [2024/9/23] ðŸ”¥ Interactive Motion Painter UI for ComfyUI
- [2024/9/20] ðŸ”¥ Added basic IP Adapter integration
- [2024/9/16] ðŸ”¥ Uodated model code to be compatible with Comfy's diffusers version

## TODO
- Convert the code to be Comfy Native
- Reduce VRAM usage
- More motion controls
- Train longer context models

## Nodes
- ***MI2V Flow Predictor*** takes as input a first frame and option motion prompt, mask and vectors. Outputs a predicted optical flow for a 16 frame animation with the input image as the first frame. You can view a preview of the motion where the colors correspond to movement in 2 Dimensions ![colors](assets/colors.jpg)
- ***MI2V Flow Animator*** takes the predicted flow and a starting image and generates a 16 frame animation based on these
- ***MI2V Motion Painter*** allows you to draw motion vectors onto an image to be used by MI2V Flow Predictor
- ***MI2V Pause*** allows you to pause the execution of the workflow. Useful for loading a resized image into MI2V Flow Predictor or checking you like the predicted motion before committing to further animation
